# ROV Autonomous

## Description

The **ROV Autonomous** project aims to create an autonomous underwater vehicle (ROV) capable of navigating underwater environments. The software detects 15x15 red squares via image processing and provides real-time feedback for precise control.

## Features

- **Red Square Detection**: The software identifies 15x15 red squares in the ROV's field of view.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback to the operator for precise control.
- **Underwater Navigation**: Enables autonomous navigation in underwater environments.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/keyframesfound/rov-autonomous.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Recommended Hardware

To get the most out of the **ROV Autonomous** software, consider using the following hardware components:

- **ROV Platform**: Choose a robust underwater vehicle platform with good maneuverability. Look for models that allow easy integration of sensors and cameras.
- **Camera System**: Invest in a high-resolution camera system with low-light capabilities. A camera with adjustable focus and exposure settings is ideal.
- **Depth Sensor**: Install a reliable depth sensor to help the ROV maintain its position and avoid collisions.
- **Microcontroller or Single-Board Computer (SBC)**: Use a powerful microcontroller or SBC (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson) to run the software.
- **Thrusters and Motors**: Select efficient thrusters and motors for precise movement control.

## Compatible Software

The **ROV Autonomous** software works seamlessly with the following tools and libraries:

- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and red square detection.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the software.
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: If you're building a more complex ROV system, consider integrating with ROS for communication between different components.
- **GStreamer**: For streaming real-time video from the camera to the operator's interface.

## Usefulness and Applications

The **ROV Autonomous** software has several practical applications:

1. **Underwater Inspections**: Use the ROV to inspect underwater structures, pipelines, and marine ecosystems. The red square detection feature can help identify specific objects of interest.
2. **Search and Rescue**: Deploy the ROV in emergency situations to search for missing persons or retrieve objects from underwater locations.
3. **Scientific Research**: Researchers can study marine life, underwater habitats, and geological formations using the autonomous ROV.
4. **Environmental Monitoring**: Monitor pollution levels, track changes in underwater environments, and collect data for conservation efforts.

By combining hardware, software, and real-time feedback, the **ROV Autonomous** project empowers users to explore and interact with the underwater world more effectively.
