# ROV Autonomous

## Description

The **ROV Autonomous** project is a cutting-edge endeavor in underwater robotics. Our goal is to create an autonomous underwater vehicle (ROV) that combines advanced image processing, real-time feedback, and precise navigation capabilities. Whether for scientific exploration, environmental monitoring, or search and rescue missions, our ROV aims to revolutionize underwater operations.

## Features

1. **Red Square Detection**:
   - Our software employs sophisticated image processing techniques to identify 15x15 red squares within the ROV's field of view. This feature is crucial for detecting specific objects of interest, such as submerged markers or anomalies.

2. **Real-Time Feedback**:
   - Immediate feedback is essential for precise control. Our system provides operators with real-time information about the ROV's position, orientation, and environmental conditions. Whether adjusting thrusters or avoiding obstacles, operators can make informed decisions on the fly.

3. **Underwater Navigation**:
   - Navigating underwater environments presents unique challenges. Our autonomous navigation system leverages depth sensors, compass data, and obstacle avoidance algorithms to guide the ROV safely through murky waters. Whether exploring shipwrecks or inspecting underwater infrastructure, our software ensures reliable navigation.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store your local copy of the repository.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/keyframesfound/rov-autonomous.git
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder:
     ```
     cd rov-autonomous
     ```
   - Install the required dependencies using pip:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure Your Environment**:
   - If necessary, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```
       myenv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS and Linux:
       ```
       source myenv/bin/activate
       ```

4. **Run the Main Script**:
   - Execute the main script to start the ROV Autonomous system:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

## Recommended Hardware

To get the most out of the **ROV Autonomous** software, consider using the following hardware components:

- **ROV Platform**: Choose a robust underwater vehicle platform with good maneuverability. Look for models that allow easy integration of sensors and cameras.
- **Camera System**: Invest in a high-resolution camera system with low-light capabilities. A camera with adjustable focus and exposure settings is ideal.
- **Depth Sensor**: Install a reliable depth sensor to help the ROV maintain its position and avoid collisions.
- **Microcontroller or Single-Board Computer (SBC)**: Use a powerful microcontroller or SBC (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson) to run the software.
- **Thrusters and Motors**: Select efficient thrusters and motors for precise movement control.

## Compatible Software

The **ROV Autonomous** software works seamlessly with the following tools and libraries:

- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and red square detection.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the software.
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: If you're building a more complex ROV system, consider integrating with ROS for communication between different components.
- **GStreamer**: For streaming real-time video from the camera to the operator's interface.

## Usefulness and Applications

The **ROV Autonomous** software has several practical applications:

1. **Underwater Inspections**: Use the ROV to inspect underwater structures, pipelines, and marine ecosystems. The red square detection feature can help identify specific objects of interest.
2. **Search and Rescue**: Deploy the ROV in emergency situations to search for missing persons or retrieve objects from underwater locations.
3. **Scientific Research**: Researchers can study marine life, underwater habitats, and geological formations using the autonomous ROV.
4. **Environmental Monitoring**: Monitor pollution levels, track changes in underwater environments, and collect data for conservation efforts.

By combining hardware, software, and real-time feedback, the **ROV Autonomous** project empowers users to explore and interact with the underwater world more effectively.

## Inspirations and Similar Projects

Here are some inspiring projects and developments related to AUVs and ROVs:

1. **Armada by Ocean Infinity**:
   - Ocean Infinity, a subsea survey company, launched a subsidiary called Armada. Armada specializes in producing automated surface vessels carrying subsea ROVs. These vessels can be used for underwater inspection.

2. **Fugro and Sea-Kit International**:
   - Geological survey company Fugro is collaborating with Sea-Kit International to develop drone ships. These ships aim to minimize or eliminate the dependency on support vessels and umbilicals, making them more autonomous. Improved flexibility during offshore inspections and enhanced worker safety are key benefits of such autonomous vessels.
